# Split-and-Merge-Deep-Learning

This is a split-and-merge deep learning algorithm, named SM-DL method.
The method is proposed to learn a neural network on the dimension reduced subset data by using the split-and-merge technique on deep learning to obtain nonlinear dimension reduction of the original data.
